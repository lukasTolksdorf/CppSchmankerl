# Fibonacci Row

this "Schmankerl" was directly influenced by Jason Turners C++Weekly! Go watch it on youtube -> he is awesome!

## Compiletime

* calculated with templates and made accessible through constexpr during runtime (Version from Jason Turner)
* calculated with constexpr and made accessible similar to Jason's version
* same but with a static const array instead of constexpr for curiosity reasons
